Charlieplexing examples
=======

Charlieplexing is a technique that allows you to control several LEDs without using an arduino pin for each LED. 
You can read the basics here: https://docs.google.com/a/olx.com.ar/open?id=0BxbTVFov6rQ7alc3WGF4Q054bW8

Some examples we've done:

* auto_fantastico_1.ino
* auto_fantastico_2.ino
* auto_fantastico_pacman.ino
 * This version needs a speaker in pin 9 to make a pacman-like sound.
