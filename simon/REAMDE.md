The idea is to make a clone of that old game from the 80's [1]

We are still trying to understand how to make the buttons and LEDs work, but we are pretty close to finish the hardware part.
Once we have, we could be soldering the parts to a Arduino shield board and work on the software with the game logic.

The good thing is that once the electronic part is ok, the rest is just programming and you can improve the game as much as you can.
